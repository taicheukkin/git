Based on the provided transcript, here is a summary of the Git history and inspection concepts covered.

### Key Concepts

The core concept is using Git to **inspect and navigate the history of a repository**. This involves viewing past commits, understanding what changes were made, comparing different states of the project, and finding specific commits based on various criteria like author, date, or content.

### Implementation Steps

1.  **View the Commit Log:**
    *   Use the basic `git log` command to see a list of commits, showing their hash, author, date, and message.
    *   Use `git log --oneline` for a condensed summary.
    *   Use `git log -p` or `git log --patch` to see the exact code changes (diffs) in each commit.
    *   Use `git log --stat` to see a summary of files changed and the number of insertions/deletions per file.

2.  **Filter and Search the History:**
    *   **By number:** `git log -n 5` (shows the last 5 commits).
    *   **By author:** `git log --author="John Doe"`.
    *   **By date:** `git log --before="2020-01-01"` or `git log --after="1 week ago"`.
    *   **By commit message:** `git log --grep="bugfix"`.
    *   **By file content:** `git log -S"functionName"` (finds commits that added or removed that string).

3.  **View the History of a Specific File:**
    *   Use `git log -- <filename>` to see all commits that affected a specific file.
    *   Add the `-p` option to see the changes made to that file in each commit: `git log -p -- <filename>`.

4.  **Compare Commits (Diffs):**
    *   Use `git diff <commit-hash-1> <commit-hash-2>` to see all changes between two commits.
    *   To compare a specific file across two commits, add the filename: `git diff <hash1> <hash2> -- <filename>`.

5.  **Restore a Deleted File:**
    *   Find the commit where the file was last present using `git log -- <deleted-file-name>`.
    *   Restore it by checking out the file from that commit: `git checkout <commit-hash> -- <file-name>`.

6.  **See Who Wrote What (Blame):**
    *   Use `git blame <filename>` to see each line of a file annotated with the commit hash, author, and date it was last modified.
    *   Use `-L` to limit the output to specific lines: `git blame -L 1,5 <filename>`.

7.  **Checkout Old Commits (Detached HEAD State):**
    *   Use `git checkout <commit-hash>` to temporarily restore your working directory to a previous state.
    *   **Warning:** This puts you in a "detached HEAD" state. Avoid making new commits here. To return to the present, run `git checkout master` (or your main branch name).

### Vivid Example

Imagine you're working on a website and the "Buy Now" button suddenly stops working. You know it worked yesterday, but you're not sure which change broke it.

1.  **Inspect the History:** You run `git log --oneline --after="yesterday"` to see a list of all commits from the last day. You see five commits from different team members.
2.  **Find the Culprit:** You use `git bisect start`, mark the current commit as "bad," and find an old commit where the button worked to mark as "good." Git automatically checks out commits in the middle of the history for you to test. After a few steps, Git identifies the exact commit that introduced the bug.
3.  **See What Broke:** You run `git show <bad-commit-hash>` to see the precise code changes in that commit. You immediately spot that a teammate accidentally changed the button's CSS class name.
4.  **See Who Made the Change:** You navigate to the button's HTML file and run `git blame button.html`. The `git blame` output clearly shows your teammate's name next to the line with the incorrect class, confirming your finding.
5.  **Fix the Issue:** You can now confidently revert that specific change or fix the class name, having used Git's history to quickly diagnose the problem.2627.35,"location":2,"content":"As I told you"},{"from":2627.62,"to":2629.32,"location":2,"content":"You have to right click that come as an"},{"from":2629.77,"to":2630.54,"location":2,"content":"Go to create a Kik"}]}
