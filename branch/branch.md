## Git Branching Summary

This transcript is a comprehensive tutorial on using branches in Git, covering fundamental concepts, common workflows, and advanced techniques.

### Core Concepts
*   **What is a Branch?** A branch is an isolated workspace that allows you to diverge from the main line of development (e.g., `master` or `main`). This lets you work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the stable codebase.
*   **How Git Branches Work:** Unlike other version control systems, Git branches are very lightweight because they are just pointers to a specific commit. Creating and switching branches is fast and efficient.

### Key Branching Operations
1.  **Creating & Switching Branches:**
    *   `git branch <branch-name>`: Creates a new branch.
    *   `git switch <branch-name>` or `git checkout -b <branch-name>`: Switches to a branch (the latter creates and switches).
    *   Use descriptive naming conventions (e.g., `bugfix/signup-form`).

2.  **Comparing Branches:**
    *   `git log master..bugfix` : Shows commits in `bugfix` but not in `master`.
    *   `git diff master..bugfix`: Shows the actual code differences between the two branches.

3.  **Stashing Changes:**
    *   `git stash`: Temporarily shelves uncommitted changes to allow for a clean branch switch.
    *   `git stash apply`: Re-applies the stashed changes later.

### Merging Strategies
The tutorial covers several ways to integrate changes from one branch into another:

*   **Fast-Forward Merge:** The default when there is a linear path from the target branch (e.g., `master`) to the source branch. Git simply moves the pointer forward.
*   **Three-Way Merge:** Used when branches have diverged. Git creates a new "merge commit" that combines changes from both branches.
*   **Squash Merge:** Combines all commits from a feature branch into a single commit on the target branch. This results in a cleaner, linear history.
*   **Rebasing:** Replays the commits from one branch onto the tip of another. This creates a linear history but **rewrites commit history**, so it should only be used on local, unpublished branches.

### Handling Conflicts
*   **Merge Conflicts** occur when the same part of a file is changed differently in two branches.
*   When a conflict happens, you must manually resolve it by editing the file, choosing which changes to keep (or a combination).
*   The file will contain conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) to guide you.
*   After resolving, you must `git add` the file and `git commit` to complete the merge.

### Essential Tools & Techniques
*   **Cherry-Picking:** Applying a specific commit from one branch to another using `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`.
*   **Undoing a Merge:**
    *   `git merge --abort`: Cancels a merge in progress (before committing).
    *   `git reset --hard HEAD~1`: Removes a faulty merge commit by resetting the branch pointer (use with caution on shared history).
    *   `git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>`: Safely undoes a merge by creating a new commit that reverses the changes, which is the preferred method for public history.
*   **Viewing Merged Branches:**
    *   `git branch --merged`: Lists branches that have been merged into the current branch.
    *   `git branch -d <branch-name>`: Safely deletes a branch that has been merged.

### GUI Tools
The tutorial also demonstrates using graphical tools like **GitKraken** and **p4merge** to visualize branches, resolve conflicts, and perform operations more easily.

### Key Takeaway
Mastering branching fundamentally changes software development by enabling isolated, parallel workstreams that can be safely integrated, making it a core skill for any developer using Git.
